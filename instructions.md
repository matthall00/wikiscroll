# WikiScroll - A TikTok-style Wikipedia Reader

## Project Overview
WikiScroll is a modern, engaging way to discover Wikipedia content through a TikTok-like interface. Users can vertically scroll through full-screen Wikipedia articles, save their favorites, and explore content through different discovery methods.

## Core Features
- Vertical scrolling feed with smooth transitions
- Full-screen article cards with:
  - Background image from the article
  - Article title
  - Brief excerpt/summary
  - Link to full Wikipedia article
- Multiple content discovery methods:
  - Random articles feed
  - Category-based browsing
  - Interest-based customization
  - Search functionality
- User preferences:
  - Save articles for later
  - Track viewed articles
  - Manage interests/categories

## Technical Stack
- Vite + React
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching
- LocalStorage/IndexedDB for client-side storage
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## API Integration
### Wikipedia API Endpoints
- Random Articles: `/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&generator=random`
- Category Articles: `/w/api.php?action=query&list=categorymembers`
- Article Content: `/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts|pageimages`
- Search: `/w/api.php?action=query&list=search`

Note: Implement proper CORS handling and rate limiting

## Key Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Virtual Scrolling Implementation
  - Use Intersection Observer for viewport detection
  - Unmount off-screen articles to reduce DOM nodes
  - Keep 3-5 articles in memory at a time
- Image Optimization
  - Use next-gen formats (WebP with JPEG fallback)
  - Implement progressive loading with blur placeholder
  - Preload images for next 2-3 articles
- Caching Strategy
  - Cache API responses with React Query
  - Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern
  - Use service worker for offline support
- Performance Metrics
  - Target First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
  - Maintain 60fps scroll performance
  - Keep bundle size under 100KB (gzipped)

### Storage Architecture
- LocalStorage
  - User preferences and settings

  - Recently viewed article IDs
- IndexedDB
  - Article cache with TTL
  - Saved articles with full content
  - Reading history with timestamps
- Memory Cache
  - Current feed articles
  - Preloaded next page
  - Search results

### Error Handling Strategy
- API Error Handling
  - Implement exponential backoff for retries
  - Show appropriate error states per component
  - Cache last successful response as fallback
- Content Fallbacks
  - Default placeholder images
  - Truncated content handling
  - Offline mode indicators
- User Feedback
  - Toast notifications for actions
